### General Observations:
1. **Register Values**:
   - The values displayed for each register (e.g., `0x0`, `0xc00000`, `0x202`, etc.) correspond to the current content of the memory at those addresses. 
   
2. **Explanation Consistency**:
   - Each register is accompanied by an explanation of its purpose. It clarifies the role of each register for the user.

3. **Registers**:
   - All LPUART peripherals have been checked for the following registers: `PINCFG`, `STAT`, `PARAM`, `CTRL`, `MATCH`, `MODIR`, `GLOBAL`, `FIFO`, `WATER`, `VERID`, `DATA`, and `BAUD`.

4. **Memory Address & Registers**:
   - The script successfully outputs the base address for each LPUART (e.g., `0x4019c000` for LPUART7).
   - The script reads from the correct register offsets (e.g., `PINCFG`, `STAT`, `BAUD`), which is consistent across all peripherals.

### Potential Improvements:
- **Enhanced Status Information**:
  
It might be interesting to translate the raw values of `STAT` (*Status*) and similar registers into known error codes or conditions.
